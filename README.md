Step 1: Project Setup
Create Project Folder:
Create a new folder for your project. This will be the main directory for all your project files.
Step 2: HTML File
Create HTML File:
Inside your project folder, create an HTML file (e.g., index.html). This is where you'll structure your webpage.
Step 3: CSS File
Create CSS File:
Create a separate CSS file (e.g., style.css) to style your HTML elements.
Step 4: JavaScript File
Create JavaScript File:
Create a JavaScript file (e.g., script.js) to write your application logic.
Step 5: Leaflet and OpenWeatherMap Setup
Include Leaflet and OpenWeatherMap Libraries:
In your HTML file, include the Leaflet and OpenWeatherMap script and stylesheet links.
<!-- Add these lines in the head section of your HTML file -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/leaflet@1.9.4/dist/leaflet.css"
  integrity="sha256-p4NxAoJBhIIN+hmNHrzRCf9tD/miZyoHS5obTRR9BMY=" crossorigin="" />

<!-- Add this line at the end of the body section -->
<script src="script.js" defer></script>
